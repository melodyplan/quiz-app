## Introduction

This is a basic quiz app project for Thinkful created entirely from scratch and based on the tabletop game, Magic the Gathering.

This project features my first time use of Bootstrap and Javascript.

## How to Use

1. Flip (click) the card to start the quiz. Alternatively there is a fun "Keep flippin'" button at the top left for those who want to keep flipping the card over and over. This button can also be pressed during the quiz without affecting the user's quiz score.

2. The green "Submit" button will not be clickable until the user selects an answer. They can also go to previous questions by clicking "Previous." The number on the top left hand corner keeps track of what question the user is on.

3. Depending on how the user answered the question before, an alert message will pop up letting the user know whether they got it wrong or right.
